# Penguin-Data-Analysis
Aim to use classification to determine Penguin's species.
An important task in the ecology of the Antarctic is to catalog the many different species of penguins in that area. Determining the species of a penguin often requiresa combination of biological expertise and many precise measurements, which can be difficult to obtain.
Goal: Determine a small set of measurements that are highly predictive of a penguinâ€™s species.
